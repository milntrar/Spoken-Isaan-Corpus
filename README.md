# Spoken Isaan Corpus
An ongoing project to document Isaan (ISO code : tts), a language variety spoken in Northeast Thailand. The project started in 2018 and currently consists of 36,127 words.

## Linguistic data
The language data is written in Thai script with annotation for code-switching. The data has been fully morphologically parsed but only partially transcribed into IPA, glossed, and translated into English. The corpus is originally designed to be used on a software for language and cultural data called [FieldWorks Language Explorer](https://software.sil.org/fieldworks/)(FLEx).
